        <h3>
            A Brief History
        </h3>

        <p>Bendigo <em>(Ben-dig-oh)</em> is a city in Victoria, Australia, located in the Bendigo Valley near the
            geographical
            centre of the state and approximately 150 kilometres (93 miles) north-west of Melbourne, the state
            capital.<br />
            <br />
            As of 2019, Bendigo had an urban population of 100,991 making it Australia's 19th-largest city,
            fourth-largest inland city, and the fourth-most populous city in Victoria. It is the administrative
            centre
            of
            the City of Greater
            Bendigo, which encompasses outlying towns spanning an area of approximately 3,000 km2 (1,158 sq miles)
            and
            over
            111,000 people.<br />
            <br />
            The traditional owners of the land are the Dja Dja Wurrung <em>(Ja-Ja-war-rung)</em> people are
            Aboriginal
            Australians.<br />
            <br />
            The discovery of gold on Bendigo Creek in 1851 transformed the area from a sheep station into one of
            colonial Australia's largest boomtowns. News of the finds intensified the Victorian gold rush, bringing
            an
            influx of
            migrants from around the world, particularly Europe and China. Bendigo became eastern Australia's
            largest
            19th-century gold-mining economy and the wealth generated during this period is reflected today in the
            city's
            Victorian
            architectural heritage. From 1853 until 1891, Bendigo was officially named Sandhurst.<br />
            <br />
            Bendigo's boom period lasted until the early 20th century and after a temporary decline in population
            and
            employment, renewed growth occurred from the 1930s as the city consolidated as a manufacturing and
            regional
            service
            centre. Although gold mining continues, recent population growth has been most heavily concentrated in
            suburban
            areas. With
            the completion of the Calder Freeway linking Melbourne and Bendigo in 2009, and the region's proximity
            to
            Melbourne, Bendigo has become one of the fastest-growing regional centres in Victoria.<br />
